        often called include (sometimes copy or import), that causes the 
        contents of a second file to be inserted into the original file. These 
        included files are called copybooks or header files. They are often used
        to define the physical layout of program data, pieces of procedural code
        and/or forward declarations while promoting encapsulation and the reuse
        of code.<strong><a href="">No Flag here</a></strong></p></p></div>
